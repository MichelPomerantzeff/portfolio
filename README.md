Here is my portfolio which I built with HTML, CSS and a touch of JavaScript to illustrate some of the work I have done so far as well as what I am capable of doing regarding my set of skills.
It also includes information about me such as a short description of myself, contacts, and links to reaching out to me through a few of my social medias.

## ðŸš€ Stack & Tools Used:
